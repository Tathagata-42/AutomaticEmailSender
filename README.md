# Automactic Email Sender

This is a python script which helps us to send email to a **person or a group automatically** . In this script , we have used **BeautifulSoup for web scraping** .The BeautifulSoup library will help us to extract the contents from the website 

Along with BeautifulSoup , we are also using the requests library in order to connect it with the server . 

We have used the **smtp.gmail.com** as our smtp server . The port number of gmail is **587**. 

For the body of the email , the subject section uses the day , month and year so that it doesnt get overlapped with the previous email .
